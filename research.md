## Research highlights

### Global urban precipitation anomalies

Urbanization is a global change underway that is affecting regional weather and climate extremes, which play an emergent role in accelerating the frequency of extreme weather events in cities. This project will map urban rainfall hotspots across the globe with statistical and data-driven causal analysis methods. Further, we will analyze the urban precipitation anomalies covering a wide range of geography and climatological conditions, which are dominated by different urban precipitation processes. This study will help to project extreme precipitation in city areas and benefit society and decision-makers to create a resilient urban environment in response to extreme weather under global warming.
